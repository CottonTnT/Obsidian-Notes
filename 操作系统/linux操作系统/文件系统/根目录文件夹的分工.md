## /tmp


- the tmp (temporary) directory under root is used to store the data used by the system and user applications to store the data that are needed for a short period of time. Most Linux distributions are preconfigured to empty the tmp directory after each reboot.


### 与/var/tmp 的区别

- The short answer is how they both deal with the temporary files.

The `/tmp` directory is used to store the short-lived temporary files whereas the `/var/tmp` directory is used to store long-lived temporary files.

- **Endurance:** Generally, the files stored in the `/tmp` directory are removed at the boot time whereas the files inside `/var/tmp` are kept even after reboot.
- **For user VS Systemwide:** Typically, the files inside the `/tmp` directory can be accessed by every user whereas the files of `/var/tmp` are mostly user-specific.
- **Usage (the most crucial difference):** The `/tmp` directory is used to store the files that are needed for a short time like for the installation of a package. Whereas the `/var/tmp` directory is used for files that are needed for a longer period of time like system backup or log files.
